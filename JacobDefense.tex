I would like to acknowledge Professor Kamalika Chaudhuri for her support as the
chair of my committee. Her guidance and advising was invaluable to my work.

I would also like to acknowledge my office mates in lab~4142, who have given
very useful feedback, advice, and support over the past five years.

% Put your maximum 350 word abstract here.
\begin{dissertationabstract}
The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
study. The abstract may continute onto a second page if necessary. The
text of the abstract must be double spaced.

% Optional Introduction
\begin{dissertationintroduction}
This optional section is barely described in the OGS manual other than
saying it is optional and that it appears in the table of contents
between the Abstract and the first chapter.

No formatting guidelines appear so presumably, it should be formatted
like an ordinary chapter. It should appear after the
\verb!\mainmatter! macro because it should start on page~1.
