who inspired me to strive to be my best from a young age. Second, to my
sister Lauren and brother David, for helping and supporting me along the way. 
I love you all!

\begin{acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I extend my sincerest gratitude to my advisor,
Professor Kamalika Chaudhuri, for making this entire journey possible.
I didn't have much direction or confidence when I arrived at UCSD,
but Kamalika saw potential in me and guided me into research. When 
something finally stuck, Kamalika let me fly more freely and allowed me
to develop my own style. She has also provided invaluable connections and
collaborations throughout the years, without which many of my research 
projects would not have been possible.

Second, I greatly appreciate my office mates 
in lab~4142; with whom I have laughed, learned, opened up, and shared
so many meaningful experiences. My PhD certainly wouldn't have been possible without 
this group. In particular, I would like to extend thanks to
Mary Anne Smart, who has helped me with many problems related to work and to 
life, and who I can always count on to be a voice of reason. Next,
thanks to Casey Meehan for his light-heartedness and generosity,
especially when I was experiencing more difficult times. Next, 
thanks to Robi Bhattacharjee from whose uncanny intelligence and varied interests
I have learned lots. Finally, thanks to Amrita Roy Chowdhury, whose
extreme aptitude in research and other intellectual pursuits I find quite
inspiring and have taught me lots.

Third, I am very grateful to my collaborators over the years. My collaboration
with Takao Murakami has been my most successful one, in no small part due to 
his amazing work ethic and keen eye for interesting research projects. It has
been an absolute pleasure to work with him. Thanks to Abhinav Aggarwal, my
collaborator and manager during my time at Amazon, for setting up an interesting,
enriching research project during my time there. Thanks to Alessandro Epasto, my 
collaborator/manager at Google, who also set up an amazing research project during my
time at Google. Finally, I have benefitted greatly from working with 
Amrita Roy Chowdhury, who has an incredible amount of knowledge and research 
expertise.

Lastly, I am so grateful to my friends and family. To my friends 
from both UCSD and from Carnegie
Mellon: we have kept each other in our lives for a reason, and I hope
to share many more fun times with you all in the future. To my family: thanks
for loving and supporting me throughout my life.

% Put your maximum 350 word abstract here.
\begin{dissertationabstract}
The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
study. The abstract may continute onto a second page if necessary. The
text of the abstract must be double spaced.

% Optional Introduction
\begin{dissertationintroduction}
This optional section is barely described in the OGS manual other than
saying it is optional and that it appears in the table of contents
between the Abstract and the first chapter.

No formatting guidelines appear so presumably, it should be formatted
like an ordinary chapter. It should appear after the
\verb!\mainmatter! macro because it should start on page~1.
