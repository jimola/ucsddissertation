    \section{Conclusion}\label{chap4-sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have investigated the impact of poisoning attacks on degree estimation for graphs under \ldp. We have presented a formal framework for analyzing the robustness of a protocol against poisoning. Our framework can quantify the impact of a poisoning attack on both honest and malicious users. 
Additionally, we have proposed novel robust degree estimation protocols under \ldp~by leveraging the natural data redundancy in graphs, that can significantly reduce the impact of poisoning attacks.
