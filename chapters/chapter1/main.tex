% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

Differentially private analysis of graphs is widely used for releasing statistics from sensitive graphs while still preserving user privacy. Most existing algorithms however are in a centralized privacy model, where a trusted data curator holds the entire graph. As this model raises a number of privacy and security issues -- such as, the trustworthiness of the curator and the possibility of data breaches, it is desirable to consider algorithms in a more decentralized local model where no server holds the entire graph. 


In this work, we consider a local model, and present algorithms for counting subgraphs -- a fundamental task for analyzing the connection patterns in a graph -- with LDP (Local Differential Privacy). For triangle counts, we present algorithms that use one and two rounds of interaction, and show that an additional round can significantly improve the utility. For $k$-star counts, we present an algorithm that achieves an order optimal estimation error in the non-interactive local model. 
We provide new lower-bounds on the estimation error for general graph statistics including triangle counts and $k$-star counts. 
Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two real datasets, and show that it is indeed possible to accurately estimate 
subgraph counts in the local differential privacy model.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{chap1-sec:conclusions}
% In this paper, 
We presented a series of algorithms for counting triangles and $k$-stars under LDP. 
We 
% analyzed the upper-bounds on the expected $l_2$ loss for these algorithms, and 
showed that an additional round can significantly reduce the estimation error in triangles, and the algorithm based on the Laplacian mechanism provides an order optimal error in the non-interactive local model. 
We also showed lower-bounds for general functions including triangles and $k$-stars. 
We conducted experiments using two real datasets, and showed that our algorithms achieve small relative errors, especially when the number of users is large.

As future work, we would like to develop algorithms for other subgraph counts such as cliques and $k$-triangles \cite{Karwa_PVLDB11}.
