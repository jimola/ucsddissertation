\section{Conclusions}
\label{chap1-sec:conclusions}
% In this paper, 
We presented a series of algorithms for counting triangles and $k$-stars under LDP. 
We 
% analyzed the upper-bounds on the expected $l_2$ loss for these algorithms, and 
showed that an additional round can significantly reduce the estimation error in triangles, and the algorithm based on the Laplacian mechanism provides an order optimal error in the non-interactive local model. 
We also showed lower-bounds for general functions including triangles and $k$-stars. 
We conducted experiments using two real datasets, and showed that our algorithms achieve small relative errors, especially when the number of users is large.

As future work, we would like to develop algorithms for other subgraph counts such as cliques and $k$-triangles \cite{Karwa_PVLDB11}.
