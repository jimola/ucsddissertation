Our results apply to arbitrarily interactive privacy mechanisms, and they also give sharp lower bounds for all levels of differential privacy protections, that is, privacy mechanisms with privacy levels \${\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}in [0, {\textbackslash}infty)\$. As a particular consequence of our results, we show that the minimax mean-squared error for estimating the mean of a bounded or Gaussian random vector in \$d\$ dimensions scales as \${\textbackslash}frac\{d\}\{n\} {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}frac\{d\}\{ {\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon, {\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}\}\}\$.},
