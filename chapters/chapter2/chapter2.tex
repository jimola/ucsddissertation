\section{Conclusions}
\label{chap2-sec:conclusions}
% In this paper, we proposed
% locally private
We proposed
triangle counting algorithms under edge LDP with a small estimation error and small communication cost.
We showed that
% the estimation error can be significantly reduced by our 4-cycle trick and double clipping, and that
our entire algorithms with the 4-cycle trick and double clipping
% can 
dramatically reduce the download cost
% when compared with
of
\cite{Imola_USENIX21},
% (e.g., from $400$ Gbits to $100$ Mbits).
e.g., from 6 hours to 8 seconds or less. 
% when $20$ Mbps).

% In this paper,
We assumed that each user $v_i$ honestly inputs her neighbor list $\bma_i$, as in most previous work on LDP.
However, recent studies \cite{Cao_USENIX21,Cheu_SP21} show that the estimate in LDP can be skewed by data poisoning attacks.
% with a number of malicious accounts.
As future work, we would like to analyze the impact of data poisoning on our algorithms and develop defenses (e.g., detection) against it.
