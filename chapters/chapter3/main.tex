Subgraph counting is fundamental for analyzing connection patterns or clustering tendencies in 
graph data. 
% a social graph. 
Recent studies have applied LDP (Local Differential Privacy) to subgraph counting to protect user privacy 
even against a data collector 
in 
% both centralized and decentralized 
social networks. 
However, existing local algorithms suffer from extremely large estimation errors or assume multi-round interaction between users and the data collector, which requires a lot of user effort and synchronization. 

In this paper, we focus on a one-round of interaction and propose accurate subgraph counting algorithms by introducing a recently studied shuffle model. 
We first propose a basic technique called \textit{wedge shuffling} to send wedge information, the main component of several subgraphs, with small noise. 
Then we apply our wedge shuffling to counting triangles and 4-cycles -- basic subgraphs for analyzing clustering tendencies -- with several additional techniques. 
% For triangles, we propose three

We also show upper bounds on the estimation error for each algorithm. 
We show through comprehensive experiments that our one-round shuffle algorithms significantly outperform the one-round local algorithms in terms of accuracy and achieve small estimation errors with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., smaller than 1 in edge DP.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we made the first attempt (to our knowledge) to 
shuffle graph data for privacy amplification. 
% apply the shuffle model to graph data. 
We proposed wedge shuffling as a basic technique and then applied it to 
% to enable the privacy amplification of graph data. 
% Then we proposed 
one-round triangle and 4-cycle counting with several additional techniques. 
% algorithms based on wedge shuffling. 
We showed upper bounds on 
% the expected $l_2$ loss 
the MSE 
for each algorithm. 
We also showed through comprehensive experiments that our one-round shuffle algorithms significantly outperform the one-round local algorithms and achieve a small relative error with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., smaller than $1$ in edge DP. 

For future work, we would like to apply wedge shuffling to other subgraphs such as 3-hop paths \cite{Sun_CCS19} and $k$-triangles \cite{Karwa_PVLDB11}.
