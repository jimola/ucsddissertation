\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap3-sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we made the first attempt (to our knowledge) to 
shuffle graph data for privacy amplification. 
% apply the shuffle model to graph data. 
We proposed wedge shuffling as a basic technique and then applied it to 
% to enable the privacy amplification of graph data. 
% Then we proposed 
one-round triangle and 4-cycle counting with several additional techniques. 
% algorithms based on wedge shuffling. 
We showed upper bounds on 
% the expected $l_2$ loss 
the MSE 
for each algorithm. 
We also showed through comprehensive experiments that our one-round shuffle algorithms significantly outperform the one-round local algorithms and achieve a small relative error with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., smaller than $1$ in edge DP. 

For future work, we would like to apply wedge shuffling to other subgraphs such as 3-hop paths \cite{Sun_CCS19} and $k$-triangles \cite{Karwa_PVLDB11}.
