Our results apply to arbitrarily interactive privacy mechanisms, and they also give sharp lower bounds for all levels of differential privacy protections, that is, privacy mechanisms with privacy levels \${\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}in [0, {\textbackslash}infty)\$. As a particular consequence of our results, we show that the minimax mean-squared error for estimating the mean of a bounded or Gaussian random vector in \$d\$ dimensions scales as \${\textbackslash}frac\{d\}\{n\} {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}frac\{d\}\{ {\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon, {\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}\}\}\$.},

abstract = {We propose simple, realistic protocols for polling that allow the responder to plausibly repudiate his response, while at the same time allow accurate statistical analysis of poll results. The protocols use simple physical objects (envelopes or scratch-off cards) and can be performed without the aid of computers. One of the main innovations of this work is the use of techniques from theoretical cryptography to rigorously prove the security of a realistic, physical protocol. We show that, given a few properties of physical envelopes, the protocols are unconditionally secure in the universal composability framework.},

abstract = {Motivated by the problem of detecting link-spam, we consider the following graph-theoretic primitive: Given a webgraph G, a vertex v in G, and a parameter δ ∈ (0, 1), compute the set of all vertices that contribute to v at least a δ fraction of v's PageRank. We call this set the δ-contributing set of v. To this end, we define the contribution vector of v to be the vector whose entries measure the contributions of every vertex to the PageRank of v. A local algorithm is one that produces a solution by adaptively examining only a small portion of the input graph near a specified vertex. We give an efficient local algorithm that computes an undefined-approximation of the contribution vector for a given vertex by adaptively examining O(1/undefined) vertices. Using this algorithm, we give a local approximation algorithm for the primitive defined above. Specifically, we give an algorithm that returns a set containing the δ-contributing set of v and at most O(1/δ) vertices from the δ/2-contributing set of v, and which does so by examining at most O(1/δ) vertices. We also give a local algorithm for solving the following problem: If there exist k vertices that contribute a ρ-fraction to the PageRank of v, find a set of k vertices that contribute at least a (ρ-undefined)-fraction to the PageRank of v. In this case, we prove that our algorithm examines at most O(k/undefined) vertices.},

abstract = {Recommender system is an important component of many web services to help users locate items that match their interests. Several studies showed that recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker injects fake data to a recommender system such that the system makes recommendations as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems (e.g., association-rule-based or matrix-factorization-based recommender systems) that are not graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store (a big app store in China). However, how to design optimized poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem.In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based recommender systems. We consider an attacker's goal is to promote a target item to be recommended to as many users as possible. To achieve this goal, our a"acks inject fake users with carefully crafted rating scores to the recommender system. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm and its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but its parameters are unknown), and blackbox (recommendation algorithm is unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based recommender systems. For instance, when 1% of users are injected fake users, our attack can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain scenarios.},

  abstract = {Triangle counting in networks under LDP (Local Differential Privacy) is a fundamental task for analyzing connection patterns or calculating a clustering coefficient while strongly protecting sensitive friendships from a central server. In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm for this task that uses two rounds of interaction between users and the server to significantly reduce estimation error. However, this algorithm suffers from a prohibitively high communication cost due to a large noisy graph each user needs to download. In this work, we propose triangle counting algorithms under LDP with a small estimation error and communication cost. We first propose two-rounds algorithms consisting of edge sampling and carefully selecting edges each user downloads so that the estimation error is small. Then we propose a double clipping technique, which clips the number of edges and then the number of noisy triangles, to significantly reduce the sensitivity of each user's query. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our algorithms dramatically reduce the communication cost of the existing algorithm, e.g., from 6 hours to 8 seconds or less at a 20 Mbps download rate, while keeping a small estimation error.},
